CurrentCalculator

The goal of this project is to have a user identify where they are from and where they are traveling to. They will need to type in the watts and amps of their charger and the system will convert it. What sets this apart from other energy calculators is that after the conversion is calculated it will scrape the web to find where to buy the correct charger.
